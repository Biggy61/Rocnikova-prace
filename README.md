# 🎮 2D Platformer School Project

This game is a fast-paced 2D platformer inspired by *Super Mario* and *I Wanna Be The Forsenbaj*, created as a high school project. Run, jump, dodge traps, defeat enemies, and rescue the princess in a world full of danger and pixel-perfect jumps. This game challenges players with tight mechanics and unforgiving level design — a true test of reflexes.

Built using **Unity**, **C#**
